## AI-Powered Learning App for Kindergarten Kids

An interactive learning app built with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and OpenAI’s GPT API. It creates personalized,
adaptive educational experiences for young children, with features like dynamic question generation, progress tracking, 
and motivating feedback—powered by real AI. Teachers and parents can manage multiple children, track learning progress, 
and see detailed analytics, all with a focus on privacy and security. The app gracefully falls back to pre-made content if AI is unavailable, ensuring a seamless experience.
